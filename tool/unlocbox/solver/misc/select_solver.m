function solver = select_solver(Fgrad, Fprox)
%SELECT_SOLVER This function choose a default solver
%   Usage: solver = select_solver(Fg, Fp)
%
%   This function chooses a default solver depending on the function Fg and
%   Fp. Fg is cell array of smooth functions and Fp a cell array of non
%   smooth functions.
