function [U,S,V] = svdecon(X)
%SVDECON Fast svds when n<<m
%   Usage: [U,S,V] = svdecon(X);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         X     : Input data (n x m)
%   Output parameters:
%         U     : Left singular vectors
%         S     : Singular values
%         U     : Right signular vectors
%
%   This function is an acceleration of svd. It is particularly efficient
%   when n<<m
