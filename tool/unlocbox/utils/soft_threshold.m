function [sz] = soft_threshold(z,T)
%SOFT_THRESHOLD soft thresholding
%   Usage:  sz = soft_threshold(z,T);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         z     : Input signal
%         T     : Threshold
%                 if T is a vector, then thresholding is applied component-wise
%
%   Output parameters:
%         sz    : Soft thresholded signal
%   
%   This function soft thresholds z by T. It can handle complex input z.
