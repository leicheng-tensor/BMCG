% LIN_MAP   Map linearly from a given range to another
%
% USAGE:
% Y = lin_map(X, lims_out, lims_in)
% 
% X can be of any size. Elements of lims_in or lims_out don't have to be in
% an ascending order.
%
% if lims_in is not specified, the minimum and maximum values are used. 
%
% Example: 
%     
% x = cos((1:50)/3) + .05*randn(1, 50);
% y = lin_map(x, [4, 2]);
% figure; plot(x, 'o'); hold all; plot(y, '*');
